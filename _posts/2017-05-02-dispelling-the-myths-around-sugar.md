# Dispelling the Myths Around Sugar
## Sixty Years On - Kate Fulton

Food is defined as *'any nutritious substance that people or animals eat or drink or that plants absorb in order to maintain life and growth'*. Documentaries like That Sugar Film and Supersize Me highlight the health consequences of consuming addictive and nutritionally poor *'food-like'* substances. Many of us know what we should and shouldn't eat, yet we seem unable to resist due to the strength of addiction and misleading marketing. For sixty years we've individually tried to navigate our way through the myriad of myths. It's time for the Government to show true leadership.

As early as the 1930's medical professionals began to notice an increase in lung cancer. Prior to the increased popularity of tobacco smoking, lung cancer had been a very rare disease. In 1956, the British Doctors Study proved that smoking was causative in increasing the risk of lung cancer and heart attacks. Despite the scientific evidence and health risks being advertised, by 1984 Maori had the highest rates of lung cancers in the world. In 1985, nearly 30 years after the conclusive findings were published, the NZ Labour Government responded, leading the world with its development of a truly comprehensive smoking cessation policy. Committed to a preventative health care model, this policy included smoke-free in public places, a 53% increase in tobacco prices, health warnings and a ban on all tobacco advertising and sponsorship. It resulted in the most rapid rate of reduction of smoking in the OECD. Work is still needed to achieve a Smokefree Aotearoa 2025 for all communities, however this history demonstrates the effectiveness of public health policy in encouraging real change to lifestyle.

Like smoking tobacco, there is no refuting the scientific evidence that increased refined sugar consumption causes nutrition-related diseases, such as dental decay, type 2 diabetes, heart disease and metabolic syndrome. With this knowledge the government has a moral responsibility to improve health outcomes. It is part of their duty of care to their citizens.

You may wonder how long the harmfulness of sugar been known? You might be surprised to discover its since 1957! That's sixty years ago this year. Because the influences of sugar on our health involves more complicated mechanisms than the effects of smoking, the biochemistry of its effect was not as clear cut. Despite this, in 1972, Nutritional Professor Yudkin published his theory based on observations in *Pure, White and Deadly.* High profit margins motivated the extremely powerful sugar industry to successfully discredit Yudkin, promote saturated fat as the culprit for heart disease and shed doubt over the addictive nature of sugar and the harm it actually does cause. Also, the consumption of sugar sweetened foods and beverages was deceptively promoted hand-in-hand with images of wellbeing and happiness.

Fortunately, some sixty years later, governments around the world are finally responding. Clearly, the current NZ government is no longer taking a lead when it comes to developing policy, but there are now models from around the world, which could at least be followed. In the UK, a sugar tax on soft drinks, which have zero nutritional benefit, will be introduced in 2018. Public Health England is also developing a comprehensive approach to reducing sugar consumption, including industry guidelines to reduce sugar by 200,000 tonnes per year by 2020.

With NZ obesity rates ranked third in the world (behind America and Mexico), the NZ Medical Association 2015 report identifies a *'public health crisis'* which it declares must be responded to via the introduction of a comprehensive public health policy. It recognises that self-regulation of the food industry has not worked, stating *"a prevailing ideology of individual responsibility and vested commercial interests have combined to thwart, dilute and undermine previous attempts at effective policies to counter the challenge of obesity."*

Around 66% of NZ voters support a refined sugar tax, similar to the one being introduced in the UK. It might be expected that the current NZ government would at least consider the popularity of this tax, reflect on its ideology and respond. Finally, surely, the experience garnered from Aotearoa's own smoking cessation policy and it's huge success is evidence enough that such public health policies do work in Aotearoa.
