## About me

I'm a third generation Nelsonian. After attending Nelson College for Girls, I completed a BSc(Hons) at University of Canterbury and a PhD in biomedical research at Cambridge University. I have three children and we lived overseas in Cambridge UK, then Melbourne, where I worked at Monash University, before returning to Nelson in 2009.

During my first term I co-shared Policy and Planning portfolio, completed Resource Management Act Commissioner training and worked on our Vision 2060. Highlights include securing the future for the Suter, NSOM, Theatre Royal and Brook Sanctuary. My interest in public health allows me to empathise with community group concerns. My ability to work collegially, whilst retaining integrity, is a strength which ensures my decision making is efficient and effective. 

I feel privileged to be a Councillor for Nelson and hope to continue to contribute to its vibrancy, whilst ensuring we have an economically stable and sustainable future.

## I'm standing for NCC and NMDHB

My strong interests in community wellbeing and environmental protection are what drew me to stand for local government. After three years on council I feel I have found my vocation. I thrive on working as part of a group of people with very different views and life experiences and I thrive on listening to new ideas and trying to find inventive ways to implement them.

I'm a third generation Nelsonian with three teenage children. We lived overseas before returning to Nelson in 2009. After attending Nelson College for Girls, I completed a BSc (1st Class Honours) at the University of Canterbury and was then awarded an Elmore PhD Scholarship for biomedical research at Cambridge University, UK. After living in Cambridge for 8 years I moved to Melbourne, where I worked as a Peter Doherty Post-doctoral Fellow at Monash University and studied medicine at Melbourne University.
 
Keeping an open mind, being fully informed and then making a decision is the best approach to making good decisions. Information comes from many sources including: pre-consultation, consultation, formal submissions, staff reports, LGA, RMA, local plans and legal advice. Listening to the community is a vital part of the decision making process.  I believe I have the ability to process all these sources of information, then carefully consider the matter in question to achieve the best outcome.

During my first term I co-shared Policy and Planning portfolio and completed Resource Management Act Commissioner training. Highlights of my term include securing the future for the Suter, NSOM, Theatre Royal and the Brook Sanctuary. I have also worked on Councils Vision 2060, it’s Social Wellbeing Policy and the draft Local Alcohol Policy.

Nelson’s Framing our Future Vision 2060 was created in 2011 and was adopted in 2013. I was a part of the Mayor’s Taskforce on Sustainability which worked with the community to develop this Vision. I believe that the four themes and the ten goals in this Vision encompass the importance of wellbeing to our community. If I am re-elected, implementing strategies to achieve our 2060 goals will be one of my main areas of focus. 

I am also standing for the NMDHB because I believe my interest and understanding of health issues can complement the work I do on council and vice versa.

I fully support the ongoing provision of grants to support the work of community organisations. With these grants organisations such as Loaves and Fishes, the Men’s Shelter, Victory Community Health, St Barnabas Church and the Nelson Environment Centre are able to deliver vital services to our community. 

I also support Community-led development; encouraging people to formulate their own plans for developing their local community. Councils can play a facilitative and supportive role in this through allowing their staff and governance body to work with the community in new ways to get things done.

As you can see I am passionate about people and their wellbeing. I am also committed to ensuring we have an economically stable and sustainable future. My interest in health allows me to empathise with community group concerns. My scientific background allows me to have a rational and open-minded understanding of issues. My ability to work collegially, whilst retaining integrity, is a strength which ensures my decision making is efficient and effective, for our communities now and in the future.
