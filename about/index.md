<center>Kate Fulton lives in Nelson, New Zealand and is a third term Nelson City Councillor. She is intending to stand for the Green Party, representing the West Coast-Tasman electorate in the 2017 central government elections.</center>

> *Kate Fulton combines compassion and a concern for her community with intelligence and demonstrated ability. — Philip Woollaston, former Mayor of Nelson.*

I was born in Nelson and have four generations of family who connect to Aotearoa, particularly the Top of the South region. I am the direct descendent of Mary Mueller, the first suffragette in New Zealand and mentor to Kate Sheppard. I have inherited her passion for positive visionary change!

After college, I completed a First Class Honours Degree majoring in Chemistry at the University of Canterbury. I was awarded an Elmore Biomedical Research PhD scholarship to attend Cambridge University. There, I met my former husband and had three children. Upon completing my PhD, we moved to Melbourne where I worked as a research scientist and completed part of a medical degree. I returned to Nelson, with my children, in 2009.

I first stood for City Council in 2010. Principle-centred, my science and health background, alongside other life experiences, allow me to combine a perceptive and rational evidence-based open-mindedness, with sincere empathy for wellbeing, equity and environmental concerns.
Over the past six years, I’ve seen the visionary change I aspire to achieve, come to fruition in many different projects. In particular, I contributed to Nelson’s inclusive Vision 2060 sustainable strategy. Implementing this overarching direction into all aspects of governance requires insightfulness, initiative and intelligent creative thinking.
Working towards achieving this vision continues to be a priority for me. As a third term Nelson City Councillor, it is a natural transition to want to take my local government experience and progressive thinking into the greater region and to a central government level. I believe I can do this with the Green Party and through representing West-Coast Tasman.

## Bio

In 1990 I left Nelson College for Girls and spent five months travelling though Europe. In 1991, I began my science degree. The physical chemistry component of this degree introduced me to the evidence-based science behind climate change and global warming.

At university, I was also introduced to a grassroots philosophy and the principles behind organic farming, vegetarianism and ideas such as reduce, re-use and recycle.

This was a natural transition in my way of thinking about life. My Quaker grandfather, a conscientious objector during WWII and founding member of Riverside Community in the Motueka Valley, had already instilled similar conservation values. I became involved in the peace movement and began to practise yoga and meditation.

In 1995, I was awarded the prestigious Elmore Studentship for biomedical research at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. I was also the recipient of an Overseas Research Students Award from the Committee of Vice-Chancellors Principals of the Universities of the United Kingdom and a Sadie Balkind Award from the Federation of University Women Trust, Canterbury Branch.

Being immersed in such a high calibre learning environment was enriching in many ways. I was able to hear talks from cutting edge research scientists and Nobel Laureates and there were few financial barriers to the level of research that could be conducted.

I became the women’s representative on the graduate committee, organising the first female dinner at the College. I was one of the first PhD students at the College to have a family whilst studying and chose to take extended maternity leave during my study. I was involved in setting up a subsidised childcare facility for students and staff.

In 2003, I was awarded a Monash University Postdoctoral Research Fellowship and undertook a research project in the field of protein crystallography. I also worked as an assistant lecturer, tutoring in biochemistry, bioinformatics and medicine. In 2004, I was awarded a Peter Doherty Postdoctoral Fellowship and continued to work in the fields of protein crystallography and protein folding.

Living in the Dandenong Ranges National Park, I was involved in establishing an alternative education Steiner stream within the mainstream setting of Olinda Primary School, which my children attended.
In 2006, I was accepted into the graduate program at Melbourne Medical School. I completed nearly three semesters before taking a leave of absence for personal reasons. I have a thorough medical-based understanding of digestion, metabolic, cardiovascular and respiratory-based disorders due to the Western diet, smoking and the increased consumption of sugar-sweetened or alcoholic beverages, as well as a clear understanding of the benefits of good nutrition and exercise.
The cultural history of alcohol, ways in which alcohol related harm occur, including domestic violence and ways of addressing addiction were explored. I also examined the increasing rate of mental health issues as a result of many environmental factors including stress, plus the benefits of exercising the mind through, for example, mindfulness and positive lifestyle choices.

In December 2010, between the two Christchurch earthquakes, a devastating house fire destroyed our family home and possessions. . Over the course of 15 months I eco-designed and project managed the rebuild of our family home. Learning about building energy and water efficient homes, plus seeing my own home come to fruition, was the light at the end of the tunnel.

Since rebuilding, I have spent many hours landscaping and establishing gardens based on permaculture principles. We have hens, berries, fruit trees and vegetables growing. Eating a mostly vegetarian diet, I continue to strive to create a sustainable home life.

In 2015, I studied midwifery, alongside my city councillor and family commitments. The course complimented much of the work I do on council, increasing my knowledge in approaches to understanding community issues, particularly from a sociology and public health perspective. The course included insightful exploration of social darwinism concepts combined with a capitalist ethos, which have resulted in modern international neoliberal polices, creating ongoing race, gender and income inequity, and institutional discrimination. The results are increasingly patent globally.

The history of feminism, female body image as a measure of self worth, myths around domestic violence and young parent needs were also explored. I also extended my understanding of Te Tiriti principles, Maori identity and Maori health issues.

As a single parent for seven years, I have awareness and insight into the myriad of potentially isolating, social and economic issues facing many single parent NZ families, as well as an understanding of the complexity of a rapidly changing culture facing young individuals as they grow up.
Our family have inherited a great love for the outdoors and have particularly strong connections to Kahurangi, Nelson Lakes and Abel Tasman National Parks, where we grew up tramping, camping, skiing and sailing. As a child, we enjoyed the use of family bach’s both at St Arnaud and Tata Beach. I grew up a member of the Mt Robert Ski Club, of which my parents and grandparents were founding members. Many weekends were spent attending working parties every summer, as well as family ski weeks and ski patrol as a teenager. As an undergraduate, I spent a summer working as a trainee ranger for DOC at St Arnaud.

With my children, we have continued to tramp in all three National Parks, plus many of the other Great Walks in the South Island. We love camping at Totaranui and enjoy holidays in Golden Bay and St Arnaud with extended family. We are members of the Mount Robert Foundation, tasked with retaining the heritage huts of the former ski field, and ski/snowboard Rainbow, Temple Basin and Wanaka.

Walking, biking, swimming, gardening, yoga and meditation are my main day-to-day relaxation and leisure activities. I attend Quaker meetings and support Refugee Services, Nelson Peace Network, Woman’s Refuge and Nelson Woman’s Centre.

My home life, personal interests and work experience, enable me to connect with many different communities, extending into the greater West-Coast Tasman region. Living in Nelson, I believe I am geographically well located to engage wholly with communities throughout the electorate. During the election campaign I am committed to travelling extensively.
I am highly organised, a fast learner and quick thinker, who has the courage and conviction to challenge the status quo and look for new ways to implement change.

I have the natural ability to think outside the square, whilst weighing up the pros and cons of every position given. I will promote my aspirations, whilst empathically listening to others points of view. I endeavour to work collegially, striving to reach consensus or a positive outcome the majority can agree on, with dignity, humility and integrity.
